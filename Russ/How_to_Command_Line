Command line functions

pwd = gives us currently working directory
ls = shows us all files in current directory
cd = change directory
less = read a file in command line
ls *csv | wc -l  = count the number of 'csv' files in current directory


pressing 'tab' key will autocomplete a file/directory if we are trying to change directory

Example:
If these are the files/directories in my current working directory
Evolution.R
Rescue.slim
Lo√Øc_is_bad_at.R

I can type 'cd Evo' then press tab key and the command line will autocomplete Evolution.R
(use this to change directory when there are spaces in your directory path (command line doesn't like spaces))
