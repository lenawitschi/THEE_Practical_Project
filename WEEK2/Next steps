Next Steps

- Define Migration Rates (0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5)
- Calculate the Median 
- Try this for different Extinction Rates?? -> plot this!! 

- maybe change the genome size to enhance computational power 
  -> reduce to 1000 bp (and then also adjust the recombination and mutation rate!)

- do like 20 reps -> then it doesn't have a large impact if in one run, the population went extinct meaning one data point is missing....
