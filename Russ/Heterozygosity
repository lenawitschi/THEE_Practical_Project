Within-population diversity

p = allele frequency of allele 1
q = allele frequency of allele 2

heterozygosity = 2*p*q

Q: how to calculate genome-wide heterozygosity?
Q: what if one population only has 1 polymorphic locus and a different population has 100 polymorphic loci - how to compare between the two?
