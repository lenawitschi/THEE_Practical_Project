New Idea: 

Look at Ne (effective size:  Ne = (4 * Nm * Nf) / (Nm + Nf)) => the dynamics of this 
Also other statistics (Fst), haplotype statistics 

->  how extinction of subpopulations affects Ne of the metapopulation (NeMeta) and of separate surviving subpopulations (NeRx) under different rates and patterns of genetic exchange (= migration rate) between subpopulations.

Where we are now: 
-> Created a R notebook with all we need, now we need to add the analyzing part + to make it work with different csv file names !!
