Use R & SLiM for evolutionary rescue
R v2024.04.1+748 
SLiM v4.2.1


00_Skeleton_R_make_input_file_Learning

Purpose: Choose different values for parameters which are then written to a slim script, which you can then run on SLiM on command line.
Script will run SLiM with the given values you have choosen.
Just runs a single set of parameter values.


01_Skeleton_R_make_input_file_Loop_over_Parameter_values

Purpose: Choose multiple different values for a given parameter. Loop over different possible values for a given parameter and output a new slim script with for each new parameter value. Output a new script for all combinations of possible parameter values (over all different parameters)
Can run multiple different combinations of parameter values.


02_Skeleton_SLiM

Purpose: Write your SLiM model in here. Soft-code all parameters that you want to investigate with your study.
eg, if you want to investigate the effect of migration on genetic diversity, soft-code in migration rate. If you want to investigate other parameters, soft-code those parameters as well

Currently, I have written the skeleton to output a csv file containing all the mutations in the metapopulation (can be subset by patch in R)


03_Skeleton_R_analyze

Purpose: Read in all your SLiM raw results, record the values of each parameter from each raw result file, calculate whatever metrics you want to investigate
ie, can calculate Fst/pi/etc whatever you're interested in
Record your metrics in a final results dataframe
Write your final results to disc

After calculating your final results you can plot, do stat tests, etc, whatever is relevant for your question



Workflow:

1) Decide what parameters you want to investigate (biological question)
2) Adapt 02 SLiM script to your specific model of interest
3) Adapt 02 SLiM script to soft-code in your parameters of interest
4) Input values of parameters of interest into 00 or 01 R code
5) Copy/paste slim scripts from 00 or 01 R code into command line
6) Adapt 03 R code to calculate your metric(s) of interest
7) Investigate final results, eg, plot final results, hypothesis testing, etc
