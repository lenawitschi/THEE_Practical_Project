Purpose: This Repository is for the THEE Research Practical Project of Emma Ochsner and Lena Witschi. 

(Oktober 2024)


**Introduction**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our biological Question is the following: 

**Metapopulation - extinction colonization model**

*What is the effect of different Migration Rates on Genome Wide Heterozygosity (within Subpopulation Diversity) in the different Subpopulations of one Metapopulation?*

- Neutral Model (mutation has fitness = 0)
- Diploid Population
- Discrete Time
- nonWF
- Looking at the entire Population and not only a sample

**Structure**

Folder WEEK1 and WEEK 2 contain the progress of our Project. The folder RUSS contains all the help (in form of code and documents) we recieved from Russ. 
Folder FINAL contains the final version of the SLiM code needed for our Model, aswell as the final R Notebook. Also included is the Presentation, Report and the Datasets we created, so that it is not mandatory to run all the SLiM simulations.
