Next Steps

- Define Migration Rates 
- Calculate the Median 
- Try this for different Extinction Rates -> plot this!! 

- maybe change the genome size to enhance computational power 
  -> reduce to 1000 bp (and then also adjust the recombination and mutation rate!)

- do like 20 reps -> then it doesn't have a large impact if in one run, the population went extinct meaning one data point is missing....
