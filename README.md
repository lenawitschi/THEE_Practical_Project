**THEE 2024 Research Practical**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose: This Repository is for the Research Practical Project of Emma and Lena. 

**Introduction**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our biological Question is the following: 

**Metapopulation - extinction colonization model in SLiM**

*What is the effect of different migration rates on (local) genetic variation - of the subpopulation - and how does this influence extinction time of the subpopulations?* (16.10.24)

*What is the effect of different migration rates on Genome Wide Heterozygosity (within subpop diversity) in the different subpopulations?* (23.10.24)


- Neutral Model (mutation has fitness = 0)
- Diploid Population
- Looking at the entire Population and not only a sample

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Next steps**

- median
- plot with prob of extinction
- plot with all lines of different extinction rates
