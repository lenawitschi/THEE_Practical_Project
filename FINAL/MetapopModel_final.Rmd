# Introduction

This is the code for our Metapopulation Migration/Extinction model. We used SLiM to generate data and R to then analyze it. We first softcode migration rate in R and how many reps we choose and which rates.

## Generating Data in SLiM with Parameters from R

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

rm(list=ls(all=TRUE)) ## clear R environment

options(scipen = 999) ## scientific notation penalty

setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/THEE_Practical_Project/FINAL")

## choose number of reps for each parameter set
reps <- 20


## Choose the different parameter values we are interested in (migration rate)
all_m <- c(0.000001, 0.00001, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.015, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5)
repetition <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)

#make a for loop for all the different values we want to test for m 
for(m in all_m){
  
    for(r in 1:reps){
  slim_code_block <- paste0("slim -d migration=",m," -d repetition=", r,"final_code.slim")
  #slim_code_block 
  system(slim_code_block)#call the code block for slim in the terminal via bash, system invokes the OS command specified by command.
}
  }

#outputs a csv file with all our data :) - (1) the mutationâ€™s id property, (2) the identifier of its mutation type, (3) its position, (4) its selection coefficient, (5) its dominance coefficient, (6) origin subpopulation identifier, (7) origin tick, and (8) prevalence.


```

## Reading in and analysing Data

In this R block, we start with reading in the Data we generated before. We then made a data frame to store all the metrics we need to start further analysis. This Data frame is saved as Example_result. We calculate the Heterozygosities within the populations for all ten patches and then fill in the Dataframe.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/THEE_Practical_Project/FINAL")

#define the migration rates
all_m <- c(0.000001, 0.00001, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.015, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5)

## all SLiM output files
slim_out_files1 <- list.files(pattern = "slim_muts_output")
slim_out_files <- slim_out_files1[!grepl("extinction", slim_out_files1)]

#install.packages("hierfstat")
library("hierfstat")

## make a dataframe to collect results
## each row in the dataframe corresponds to the results from a single SLiM simulation run
results_df <- data.frame(array(NA, dim = c(length(slim_out_files),13), dimnames = list(c(),c("m","reps","seed","p1", "p2", "p3", "p4", "p5", "p6", "p7", "p8", "p9", "p10"))))

## loop over all SLiM results files
for(i in 1:length(slim_out_files)){ 
  
  single_file <- slim_out_files[i] ## this is the name of a single SLiM result file
  
  get_the_m <- as.numeric(gsub(".*_migration =|_seed.*", "", single_file))## here we use gsub() to get the value of 'm' that we saved in the name of the results file
   get_the_reps <- as.numeric(gsub(".*_reps_|_migration.*", "", single_file)) ## do the same for reps
  
  get_the_seed <- as.numeric(gsub(".*_seed =|\\.csv","",single_file)) ## and for the seed....
  
  single_file_df <- read.csv(slim_out_files[i], sep=" ", header=F, stringsAsFactors=F) ## read the data in the SLiM results file into R
  
  ## adding in column names
  colnames(single_file_df) <- c("","Max Number of Gen","Number of Generations", "", "Deme", "mut id", "mut typ", "position on gemome", "fitness", "dominance", "original deme", "gen mut occured", "number of indiv. with mut")

  ##Create a new column with allele frequencies (Add allele freq. in a separate row (for each file))
  ##1000 is K -> So for allele freq. you have to calculate x/2000 -> consider we have diploid individuals and K=1000 -> 2000 alleles
   single_file_df$Allelefreq <- single_file_df[,13]/2000
   
  ##calculate heterozygosity per locus (2pq -> p is allele freq and q = 1-p) (within deme)
  single_file_df$Heterozygosity_l <- 2*single_file_df[,14]*(1-single_file_df[,14])
  
  ###Next step: convert to genome wide heterozygosity (within deme)
  #na.rm = TRUE ensures that any missing values (NA) in the heterozygosity column are ignored during the calculation.
  
  #genome wide heterozygosity for the sub populations
  for (x in 1:10){
  sel_row_p <- single_file_df[,5] == paste0("p",x)
  vektor_p_pol <- single_file_df[sel_row_p,15]
  vektor_p_0 <-rep(0,10000 - length(vektor_p_pol))
  h_p <- mean(c(vektor_p_pol,vektor_p_0), na.rm = TRUE)
  results_df[i,paste0("p",x)] <- h_p
  }
  

  ##Fill in the Data Frame  
  
  results_df[i,"m"] <- get_the_m ## record the value of 'u' for this particular results file
  
  results_df[i,"reps"] <- get_the_reps ## record the value of 'r' for this particular results file
  
  results_df[i,"seed"] <- get_the_seed ## record the seed for this particular results file (this lets us keep track of individual reps of a give parameter combination), ie, maybe we did 5 reps of u=1e-8 and r=1e-8, so we will have 5 rows for these specific parameter values
  
}


## choose working directory
## write your results to disc
setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/THEE_Practical_Project/WEEK2")
write.csv(results_df, "Example_Results.csv", row.names = F)


```

# Analysis

Now we read in our result file (Example_results). Since we have different extinction rates, we calculate all our metrics separately for every rate. After calculating the metrics we plot the results.

## For e = 0.1

Since the variance is so small, we do not show it in the graph.

```{r}

setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/THEE_Practical_Project/FINAL/e = 0.1")

#Since we dint want to run the first two chunks, we have to define some values again. 
all_m <- c(0.000001, 0.00001, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.015, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5)
reps <- 20

##Read in the csv file
Example_results0.1 <- read.csv("Example_Results_Kopie.csv")

##calculate the Means over the 10 subpopulations
row_mean0.1 <- rowMeans(Example_results0.1[,4:13])

## Generating the plot

##Calculate the Mean of the means of each rep.
mean_of_means0.1 <- numeric(length(all_m))
#create an empty array, where we can fill in our calculated data
result_array0.1 <- array(NA, dim = c(length(all_m), 2), dimnames = list(c(), c("mean", "mig")))

#fill in the array we defined before

  m <- all_m[i]  # Get the current migration rate

## adding our data into the generated plot

We now have 5 plots for the 5 different extinction rates. We will combine them into one plot a bit further down in the R script.

# Extinction Probabilities

To be able to say something about the probability of extinction of the metapopulation, we did the following plots:

## For e = 0.1

```{r}

#Extinction probability for e = 0.1
# Define the directory where the files are stored
setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/THEE_Practical_Project/FINAL/e = 0.1")

#create a list where we only have the files of the runs which ended in extinction
files_ex1 <- list.files(pattern = "slim_muts_output")
files_ex <- files_ex1[grepl("extinction", files_ex1)] #grepl allows you to search for a pattern in the filename

#create an empty matrix to after store our results
extinctions0.1 <- array(NA, dim = c(length(all_m), 2), dimnames = list(NULL, c("migration rate", "number of extinctions")))

# Initialize a vector to store counts
countsimextinct <- numeric(length(all_m)) #this vector will be used to save the number of simulations in which extinction happened

# fill in the `extinctions` array
for (i in seq_along(all_m)) {
  m <- all_m[i] # Get the current migration rate
  get_the_m <- as.numeric(gsub(".*_migration =|_seed.*", "", files_ex)) #get all the files (from those which ended in extinction) which have the current migration rate in the name. 
  
  #fill the empty arrow with the number of files which went extinct and show the current m
  countextinctions0.1 <- sum(get_the_m == m)
  
  # Fill in the `extinctions` table
  extinctions0.1[i, 1] <- m  # Migration rate
  extinctions0.1[i, 2] <- countextinctions0.1  # Number of extinctions
}
