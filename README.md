**Introduction**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our biological Question is the following: 

**Metapopulation - extinction colonization model in SLiM**

*What is the effect of different migration rates on (local) genetic variation - of the subpopulation - and how does this influence extinction time of the subpopulations?* (16.10.24)

*What is the effect of different migration rates on Genome Wide Heterozygosity (within subpop diversity) in the different subpopulations?* (23.10.24)


- Neutral Model (mutation has fitness = 0)
- Diploid Population
- Looking at the entire Population and not only a sample

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Next steps**

- only look at the heterozygosity in the demes, and how they vary across them
- look at different extinction rates -> how does the variance between the subpopulation change?
- same with migration rates for a fix extinction rate -> how does this influence the variance?
    extinction rates: 0, 0.001, 0.1
- plots with mean and variance per run and then take a mean and variance from this data to incorporate it into a final plot
