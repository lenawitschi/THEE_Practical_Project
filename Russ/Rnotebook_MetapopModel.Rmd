# Introduction

This is the code for our Model for Metapopulations in SLiM. We first softcode migration rate in R and how many reps we choose and which rates.

## Generating Data in SLiM with Parameters from R

```{r}

rm(list=ls(all=TRUE)) ## clear R environment

options(scipen = 999) ## scientific notation penalty

setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/THEE_Practical_Project/Russ")

## choose number of reps for each parameter set
reps <- 5


## Choose the different parameter values we are interested in (migration rate)
all_m <- c(0.2,0.3,0.4)


#make a for loop for all the different values we want to test for m 
for(m in all_m){

  ## File name for SLiM input file (this is what we will input into SLiM -> directly via bash in R)
  sh_name <- paste0("SLiM_input_migration",m,"_reps",reps,".txt")
  
  
  ## Make a code block for SLiM with your parameter values (code block = input into terminal / directly via bash command in R)
  #metapop_script_basic_test.slim -> slim code document
  slim_code_block <- paste0("slim -d migration=",m," metapop_script_basic_test.slim")
  }
 

#slim_code_block -> might not be needed...to still be tested
system(slim_code_block) #call the code block for slim in the terminal via bash, system invokes the OS command specified by command.

read.csv("~/Documents/GitHub/THEE_Practical_Project/Russ/slim_muts_output_migration =0.4_seed =3208728106824729961.csv") #File name has to be changed for newly created csv files

#outputs a csv file with all our data :) - (1) the mutationâ€™s id property, (2) the identifier of its mutation type, (3) its position, (4) its selection coefficient, (5) its dominance coefficient, (6) origin subpopulation identifier, (7) origin tick, and (8) prevalence.
