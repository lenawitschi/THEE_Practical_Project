2nd p in slim out is patch the mutation originated in

for loop for sims is not implemented, needs to be added to bash code block

idea of soft coding FILENAME in R then passing to slim then saving slim out as FILENAME - better to just output slim as is (naming file with parameter values) then loop over ALL output files - eg as 03 R file is coded
(in order to keep parameter values linked to file)
