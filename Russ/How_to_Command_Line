Command line functions

pwd = gives us currently working directory
ls = shows us all files in current directory
cd = change directory

pressing 'tab' key will autocomplete a file/directory if we are trying to change directory

Example:
If these are the directories in my current working directory
Evolution.R
Rescue.slim
Lo√Øc_is_bad_at.R

I can type 'cd Evo' then press tab key
