# Introduction

This is the code for our Model for Metapopulations in SLiM. We first softcode migration rate in R and how many reps we choose and which rates.

## Generating Data in SLiM with Parameters from R

```{r}

rm(list=ls(all=TRUE)) ## clear R environment

options(scipen = 999) ## scientific notation penalty

setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/THEE_Practical_Project/Russ")

## choose number of reps for each parameter set
reps <- 5


## Choose the different parameter values we are interested in (migration rate)
all_m <- c(0.2,0.3,0.4)
repetition <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

#make a for loop for all the different values we want to test for m 
for(m in all_m){
  
  ## File name for SLiM input file (this is what we will input into SLiM -> directly via bash in R)
 # sh_name <- paste0("SLiM_input_migration",m,".txt")
  
  ## Make a code block for SLiM with your parameter values (code block = input into terminal / directly via bash command in R)
  #metapop_script_basic_test.slim -> slim code document
  
    for(r in 1:reps){
  slim_code_block <- paste0("slim -d migration=",m," -d repetition=", r," metapop_script_basic_test.slim")
  #slim_code_block -> might not be needed...to still be tested
  system(slim_code_block)#call the code block for slim in the terminal via bash, system invokes the OS command specified by command.
}
  }



#read.csv("~/Documents/GitHub/THEE_Practical_Project/Russ/slim_muts_output_migration =0.4_seed =3208728106824729961.csv") #File name has to be changed for newly created csv files

#outputs a csv file with all our data :) - (1) the mutationâ€™s id property, (2) the identifier of its mutation type, (3) its position, (4) its selection coefficient, (5) its dominance coefficient, (6) origin subpopulation identifier, (7) origin tick, and (8) prevalence.


```

```{r}
## all SLiM output files
slim_out_files <- list.files(pattern = "slim_muts_output")

## make a dataframe to collect results
## each row in the dataframe corresponds to the results from a single SLiM simulation run
## you can add additional columns to the dataframe here if you want to record multiple different metrics (change dim size and dimnames)
results_df <- data.frame(array(NA, dim = c(length(slim_out_files),3), dimnames = list(c(),c("m","reps","seed"))))

for(i in 1:length(slim_out_files)){ ## loop over all SLiM results files
  
  single_file <- slim_out_files[i] ## this is the name of a single SLiM result file
  
  
  get_the_m <- as.numeric(gsub(".*_migration =|_seed.*", "", single_file))## here we use gsub() to get the value of 'm' that we saved in the name of the results file
   get_the_reps <- as.numeric(gsub(".*_reps_|_migration.*", "", single_file))
  
  get_the_seed <- as.numeric(gsub(".*_seed =|\\.csv","",single_file))
  
  single_file_df <- read.csv(slim_out_files[i], sep=" ", header=F, stringsAsFactors=F) ## read the data in the SLiM results file into R
  
  ## add in column names here - I was too lazy
  colnames(single_file_df) <- c("m","reps","seed")
  
  ## calculate whatever metrics you want, eg, allele frequency, Fst, etc
  ## patch 1 mutations
  for(p in 1:10){
    patch_p <- single_file_df[single_file_df[,5]=="pi",]
  }
  ## patch i mutations

  
  ## you guys calculate what you want here ##
  #metric <- 

    
  results_df[i,"m"] <- get_the_m ## record the value of 'u' for this particular results file
  
  results_df[i,"reps"] <- get_the_reps ## record the value of 'r' for this particular results file
  
  results_df[i,"seed"] <- get_the_seed ## record the seed for this particular results file (this lets us keep track of individual reps of a give parameter combination), ie, maybe we did 5 reps of u=1e-8 and r=1e-8, so we will have 5 rows for these specific parameter values
  
  #results_df[i,"metric"] <- metric ## record your metric of choice
  
}


## choose working directory
## write your results to disc
setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/THEE_Practical_Project/Russ")
write.csv(results_df, "Example_Results.csv", row.names = F)
