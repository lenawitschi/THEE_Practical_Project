**Parameters**

K = Carrying capacity per subpopulation (K1 = x, K2 = y, K3 = z, etc.)

N = number of subpopulations (probably 10)

mutr = mutation rate (fixed, same for all subpop)

recomb = recombination rate (fixed, same for all subpop), because diploid species 

n0 = starting population (in subpop 1 to start, subpops 2-10 are empty)

mut1 = mutation type (with dominace (0.5) and fitness (neutral))

g = genomic element type (length of genomic element including mutation type and base mutation rate)

e = extinction rate (same for all subpopulations) 

m = migration rate (random for every individual, but fixed value -> for every subpop the same) 

-> idea: change the migration rate to create different simulations 


**Variables**

ntot = number of individuals in the metapopulation 



**Current thoughts and questions** 

Can we inlcude a selection coefficient so that extinction rate would depend on the type of mutations in the subpopulation? 

?? Assuming that in large populations, extinction rate is smaller.... ??? 


**Task**

Create parameters for K, m in R 

Use a for loop to incorporate different migration rates in SLiM to create different simulations 

The R output gives us a command for SLiM, the SLiM run gives us an excel table with the different mutations fixed (segregation) for the different subpopulations. (different coloumns for different m)

From this we will calculate the heterozygosity with Fst to evaluate the genetic variation in the subpops. 

Fst = variation of allele frequencies in the subpopulation
